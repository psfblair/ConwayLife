This project is for experimenting with web- and mobile
development in F#.

The application is John Horton Conway's Game of Life.
Click on the screen to toggle cells to alive or dead.
Press the buttons on the screen to control the game.

The basic Life algorithm is contained in LifeCore. 
The basic HTML canvas for rendering Life to HTML is
in LifeHtml. These projects are then used by LifeWebsite
(a static page where Life runs via Javascript in the
browser) and LifeMobileSite (similar, but using 
JQuery Mobile and formatted for mobile browsers).
